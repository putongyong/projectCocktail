# Cocktail Room: a full stack website

CocktailRoom is a full stack website designed to showcase my proficiency in Javascript and Python development. This platform features a diverse array of cocktails and utilizes a combination of technologies to provide a seamless user experience. The frontend is built using the React framework, along with the `react-router-dom` library for efficient DOM control and URL management. On the backend, Python using the Django framework takes the lead, managing the database, media files, and data loading for the frontend. By separating these components, the website's maintainability is greatly enhanced.

## Technologies Used

- React
- `react-router-dom`
- Python
- Django

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm for React development
- Python and Django for the backend

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies.
3. Navigate to the backend directory and set up a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`.
4. Activate the virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows).
5. Install backend dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
6. If you have installed Docker Desktop, run `docker-compose build` then run `docker-compose up` 

## Usage

1. Start the backend server with `python manage.py runserver`.
2. Access the website at `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Folder Structure

- `/backend`: Django backend files
- `/frontend`: React frontend files
- `/media`: Media files served by Django
