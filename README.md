# Cocktail Room: a full stack website

CocktailRoom is a full stack website designed to showcase my proficiency in Javascript and Python development. This platform features a diverse array of cocktails and utilizes a combination of technologies to provide a seamless user experience. The frontend is built using the React framework, along with the `react-router-dom` library for efficient DOM control and URL management. On the backend, Pythong using the Django framework takes the lead, managing the database, media files, and data loading for the frontend. By separating these components, the website's maintainability is greatly enhanced.
